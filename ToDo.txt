1. Finish running all code. Model objects (.RDS files) currently not saved in output folder,
I will need those to make figures showing climate coefficients. 

2. For Andy: size class only for growth? Survival used all sizes in one model?

3. Figures to make

-add info on historical soil moisture to soil moisture plots

-add info on significant treatment effects to cover trend plots

-plot model coefficients

-plot model CV results

-plot OOS validation results for vital rates x treatment

-plot OOS validation results for cover x treatment (include training data?)
